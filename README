tinystats suite - v1.1
======================

1. compile the program:
   make

   if you have tinydns installed with IPv6 patch compile tinystats with:
   make -DWITH_IPV6

2. install the program:
   make install

3. edit your tinydns/log/run file like tinydns.log.run.sample
   file (remember to create tinystats output dir and chown to
   Gdnslog)

4. restart tinydns log (svc -t .../tinydns/log)

after a query, in stats there is a file, called tinystats.out, in this
file you find this:

474:0:0:0:6:0:4:0:0:0:0:73:0:0:557:0:0:0:0:0
a:ns:cname:soa:ptr:hinfo:mx:txt:rp:sig:key:aaaa:axfr:any:total:other:notauth:notimpl:badclass:noquery

the second line is like a legend of the first

5. create tinydns.conf (see variable in the top of tinydns.sh.sample),
   rename tinydns.sh.sample to tinydns.sh and run it on your crontab
   (every 5 minute is ok)

6. if you want a "humar readable" tinydns log output, you can add -h option
   before the stats dir!
   With this option the log look like this:

192.168.0.2     01896 [23391] + PTR  2.0.168.192.in-addr.arpa
192.168.0.50    50728 [14731] + MX   home.morettoni.local
192.168.0.50    46493 [18677] + MX   home.morettoni.local

7. if you use tinydns as a slave of BIND (or other software) master
   you can set -s option, followed by a path to a external program (or
   shell script). When tinydns receive a notify about zone change from
   master it log a line with I and SOA (006) value; your external program
   fetch (with tcpclient and axfr-get) the new zone and put into your
   local data file. See update_slave.sh.sample file for an example, it
   need a configurazion file (tinydns/root/allow) with a list of zone
   and IP of the master server, one per line, like this:
   zoneA.tld:MASTER_IP
   zoneB.tld:ANOTHER_MASTER_IP

   Another example is Makefile.example that replace original Makefile
   inside tinydns/root directory; it merge all download data file
   and compile it for tinydns use.
   The external program is run with two argument: master IP address and
   name of the zone.
   Check ZONEDIR variable in the example script if you want to save
   master zone file in other directory than tinydns/root.
